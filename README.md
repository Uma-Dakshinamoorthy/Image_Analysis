# Advanced Image Analysis with napari

A comprehensive toolkit for quantitative image analysis leveraging the napari viewer framework. This library provides robust implementations of state-of-the-art image processing algorithms with an emphasis on biological and microscopy applications.

## Features

- **Sophisticated Filtering**: Implementation of advanced noise reduction filters including non-local means, bilateral, and anisotropic diffusion
- **Precise Segmentation**: Multi-scale watershed, SLIC superpixels, and deep learning-based segmentation approaches
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Comprehensive feature extraction for morphological and textural properties
- **Interactive Visualization**: Custom napari widgets for real-time parameter tuning and result inspection
- **Pipeline Construction**: Modular design allowing flexible workflow creation for complex analysis tasks

## Installation

```bash
# Create a new conda environment (recommended)
conda create -n img-analysis python=3.9
conda activate img-analysis

# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-napari.git

# Alternative: Clone and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-napari.git
cd image-processing-napari
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import napari
from image_processor import core, filters

# Load an image
image = core.load_image('path/to/image.tif')

# Apply preprocessing
filtered_image = filters.adaptive_gaussian(image, sigma=2.0, local_neighborhood=15)

# Visualize results
viewer = napari.Viewer()
viewer.add_image(image, name='Original')
viewer.add_image(filtered_image, name='Filtered')
napari.run()
```
