# Integration Plan: NEUBIAS Modules into Repository

This document outlines the strategy for integrating NEUBIAS training modules into our repository structure while maintaining attribution and enhancing the content.

## 1. Repository Structure Update

```
image-processing-napari/
├── ... (existing structure)
├── learning/
│   ├── ... (existing learning materials)
│   └── neubias-modules/          # New directory for NEUBIAS content
│       └── ... (NEUBIAS modules)
└── references/
    └── neubias-originals/        # Links to original NEUBIAS materials
```

## 2. Integration Approach

### Phase 1: Direct Incorporation
- Import the essential NEUBIAS modules that align with our learning path
- Update code to work with our environment and dependencies
- Add clear attribution to NEUBIAS in each notebook

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Add napari-specific functionality to each module
- Expand examples with additional datasets
- Create complementary exercises for each module

### Phase 3: Bridge Content
- Create "bridge" notebooks that connect NEUBIAS modules to our custom content
- Develop advanced extensions that build upon NEUBIAS fundamentals
- Cross-reference between our materials and NEUBIAS modules

## 3. Key Module Adaptations

| NEUBIAS Module | Our Adaptation | Enhancements |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Introduction to BioImage Analysis | Expanded introduction with napari visualization | Interactive widgets, 3D visualization examples |
| Image Filtering | Enhanced filtering with performance comparisons | Custom filter implementations, parameter optimization |
| Segmentation | Extended with modern approaches | Deep learning integration, interactive segmentation tools |
| Object Analysis | Comprehensive feature extraction | Statistical analysis, visualization of features |

## 4. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Fork/clone original NEUBIAS materials for reference
- [ ] Set up proper attribution and licensing notices
- [ ] Update Python dependencies to match our environment
- [ ] Adapt code examples for napari compatibility
- [ ] Create consistent styling across original and new content
- [ ] Develop transitional content between modules
- [ ] Update README and documentation to reflect NEUBIAS integration

## 5. Benefits of Integration

1. **Complete Learning Experience**: Combines NEUBIAS's excellent educational structure with our napari-focused tools
2. **Community Connection**: Acknowledges and builds upon established educational resources
3. **Broader Coverage**: Expands our repository's scope to include more bioimage-specific techniques
4. **Educational Continuity**: Provides clear paths from fundamentals to advanced implementations

## 6. Adaptation Guidelines

When adapting NEUBIAS materials:
- Maintain the pedagogical approach of the original materials
- Clearly mark our additions and modifications
- Keep code examples consistent with our style guidelines
- Ensure all examples run in our recommended environment
- Add napari visualizations while preserving original functionality

## 7. Timeline

- Week 1: Initial incorporation and compatibility updates
- Week 2: napari integration and visualization enhancements
- Week 3: Development of complementary exercises
- Week 4: Documentation and cross-referencing between modules
