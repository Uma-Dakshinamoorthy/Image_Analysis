# NEUBIAS Training Modules Integration

This directory contains adaptations and extensions of the excellent NEUBIAS Training Resources for bioimage analysis. The original modules can be found at [NEUBIAS Training Resources](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/all-modules/).

## How These Modules Are Integrated

The original NEUBIAS modules have been carefully integrated into our learning path with the following enhancements:

1. **napari Integration**: All modules have been updated to work with napari for visualization
2. **Code Modernization**: Python code has been updated to use current best practices and library versions
3. **Extended Exercises**: Additional practice problems have been added to reinforce concepts
4. **Complementary Content**: Our original content complements these modules by covering additional topics

## Module Dependencies

Each module specifies its prerequisites, but in general you'll need:

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- scikit-image
- scipy
- napari
- matplotlib
- pandas (for some data analysis modules)

## Using These Modules

These modules can be used:

1. As standalone tutorials (each notebook is self-contained)
2. As part of the complete learning path (following our recommended sequence)
3. As reference material for specific techniques
